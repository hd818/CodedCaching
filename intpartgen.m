function intlist = intpartgen(N,maxnum,intlist)
%lists all partitions of all integers up to N (first input) using at most 
%maxnum integers (second argument)
%
% i.e. all the possible ways to express N as a sum of independent integers
% e.g. 3 = {3,2+1,1+1+1}, 4={4,3+1,2+1+1,2+2,1+1+1+1}... 
%stored as 1d cell array with each cell containing all the partitions as a
%matrix of size (m by n) (integer of size n can only be partitioned by n
%integers)
%program uses 8 bit integers so can't handle above 255 unless you change 
%this, the table would become unbearably large by N = 255 anyway
%
%if "intlist" is given in the name the program will build on this as a
%starting block, allowing for use reccursively, although this wouldn't be
%that efficient, just use for extending the table slightly
%
% The argument "maxnum" indiciates the maximum numbers of integers you
% wish to allow in this partition, for example if maxnum = 4 only
% partitions with 4 integers (which can be zero) are allowed, the number 
% of these partitions is equivalent to the number allowing only numbers 
% l.t. N

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This was written to generate all the quantum numbers for 1D many body
% harmonic oscillator states satisfying E < N where E = sum(qns) for n
% particles 

% Another example problem this could solve is finding all the possible ways 
% to pay a particular sum of money in british coinage (or equivilently in
% notes /  £1 and £2 coins)
% intlist = intpartgen(value,max_number_of_coins_allowed);
% tmp = intlist(value+1)
% lg = tmp==50 | tmp == 20 | tmp==10 | tmp==5 | tmp==2 | tmp==1;
% lg2 = ~any(lg==0);
% ways_to_pay = tmp(lg2,:); %0 indicates no coin

%although it would be better to use intpartgen2 as this allows restriction
%of the range of numbers making the calculation more efficient
